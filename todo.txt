Have a config file that gets data read from. Have a default version that gets copied across if the config doesn't exist.
Include the path format for it. ie: {YYYY}/{yy}-{mm}-{dd} {EVENT}/{yy}-{mm}-{dd} {EVENT}_{NUM}{TAGS}{EXT}

using underscore.string?

detect if cameras are plugged in. perhaps looking for dcim?

face detection for tagging. OpenCV? Something more javascripty?

make a database that logs dhash (or some other hash), file path, date added, date taken, event name, thumbnail path, anything else?
Use dhash to check for existing duplicates.

Copy files to a staging area to organize and tag them, then insert into file structure as two step process.

use ffmpeg to make little thumbnails for all pictures

use rclone to run backups automatically

have cleanup tasks to do things like run through the thumbnails and delete thigns taht don't exist in DB. Track when last run. Have setting in config telling how

often to run. Run on startup.

Another cleanup task. Check files are still in folders.

use async library to limit number of ffmpeg calls at once. Throw the number of processes in the config.
